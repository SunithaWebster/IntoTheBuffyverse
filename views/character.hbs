    <p>“I'm the thing that monsters have nightmares about.”</p>
    <p>Buffy was a Slayer activated in the late 20th century. Born on January
      19, 1981, she was called to be the Slayer in 1996 at fifteen years old.
      Buffy was originally living in Los Angeles, but, due to an incident
      involving a gang of vampires at Hemery High School, she moved to Sunnydale
      with her mother, where she acted as guardian of the Hellmouth for seven
      years before the town's destruction in mid-2003.</p>
    <p>Initially a reluctant hero who constantly wished for nothing more than a
      normal life, Buffy eventually grew to embrace her destiny. She was unique
      as a Slayer in many ways; she refused to sacrifice her ordinary life for
      her supernatural destiny, often operated as part of a team with her
      friends the Scooby Gang, and had romantic relationships with the notorious
      vampires Angel and Spike.</p>
    <p>Buffy was one of the longest-lived Slayers, having returned from death
      twice and coexisted with the two next Slayers, an act that disrupted the
      magic surrounding the traditional line. During the war with the First
      Evil, Buffy enacted a plan to activate multiple Potential Slayers in the
      world, abolishing the traditional line of Chosen Ones, and closing the
      Hellmouth.</p>
