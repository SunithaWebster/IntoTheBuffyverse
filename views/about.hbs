    <h1>Planning:</h1>
    - used a Miro board to build diagram -
    <h3><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPRTgeFM=/">Link to the Project
        Diagram</a></h3>
    - adapted the existing project Trello board -
    <h3><a href="https://trello.com/b/i8kn5ccu/to-do">Link to the Project Trello
        Board</a></h3>
    - created a project git repository -
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/SunithaWebster/IntoTheBuffyverse">Link to
        the Project GitHub Repository</a></h3>
    - took time to get familiar with the legacy codebase MongoDB, Cypress,
    Express MVC controllers, routes, etc.
    <br />
    <h1>Test coverage, quality, and deployment pipeline:</h1>
    - Followed TDD process, writing tests prior to implementation:
    <br />
    - ensured that any changes to the schemas didn't break the jest tests
    <br />
    - 100% jest code coverage, but recognised that this wasn't testing front-end
    functionality
    <br />
    - therefore wrote extensive cypress tests
    <br />
    - git workflow, working on branches, creating pull requests (instituted peer
    PR approval before merge rule)
    <br />
    - ensured all tests were passing for everyone in the team before moving on
    <br />
    - 138 commits
    <br />
    <h1>Documenting learning:</h1>
    - trello board
    <br />
    - git history
    <br />
    - discussion with team - Friday retro and catch ups
    <br />
    - notes from lots of research on the existing codebase and unfamiliar
    frameworks, etc.
    <br />
    <h1>Team challenges and successes</h1>
    - Got beyond MVP working app, with all cypress and jest tests passing
    <br />
    - Got better at debugging
    <br />
    - Have learned that front-end code coverage needs to planned for and set up
    at the outset
